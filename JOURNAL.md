SPEED RUNNNNNN! rabbitboard took way too long (exactly a month). wanna get this done by the end of June cause July is busyyy. so first i started with a document and wrote everything about the project. at first it was just going to be the RC plane, but transmitters are $$$ so im gunna make that too. then i watched a bunch of vids on i. indidentally, it seems the transmitter is going to be more work than the plane 0_o. i was just going to stick a nano and antenna on a perfboard but we care about aesthetics around here. i started with making the wiring diagrams for both the transmitter and plane. started on wowki bcos i was too lazy to make a tinkercad account. am going to switch there probably. so a problem im running into is that i dont know a lick of C++, so making the firmware for the tranmitter makes me cry. <br/><br/>PLANE MATERIALS: 
* cardboard
* motor 2205 2300kv
* propeller 5045
* esc 20A FMS (eletric speed controller thing)
* 2x servos 9g
* LiPo battery
* mc6re reviever 
<br/><br/>TRANSMITTER MATS: 
* battery
* 2x joy sticks
* arduino nano
* antenna
* on/off switch
* rot encoder
* cad
* pcb

start time: 4:30am. had a psychosic vision on this and got to work
okay i'm back and it's the next morning bc i fell asleep. never slept so deeply before lol. i finished around 10pm, i cut a couple hours from the time for humans needs. 
i started wrapping up the wiring diagram for the plane, then i moved to pcb making, my second worst nightmare (first is fusion360). i was still new to pcb making so it took a long time for me to realize i don't need the exact footprint, just a connector a name the pins. god bless grabcad for the 3d models. i learned the wonders of a grandpour so wiring didn't take much time. had to update my parts: 
* 7.4v 450mah li-po battery
* XY axis joystick
* Arduino nano v3.0
* NRF24L01 + PA
* Single Pole Single Throw (SPST) Switch
* EC11 rotary encoder

it's time for 3d design D:
