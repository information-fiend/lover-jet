*LOG #001:*
SPEED RUNNNNNN! rabbitboard took way too long (exactly a month). wanna get this done by the end of June cause July is busyyy. so first i started with a document and wrote everything about the project. at first it was just going to be the RC plane, but transmitters are $$$ so im gunna make that too. then i watched a bunch of vids on i. indidentally, it seems the transmitter is going to be more work than the plane 0_o. i was just going to stick a nano and antenna on a perfboard but we care about aesthetics around here. i started with making the wiring diagrams for both the transmitter and plane. started on wowki bcos i was too lazy to make a tinkercad account. am going to switch there probably. so a problem im running into is that i dont know a lick of C++, so making the firmware for the tranmitter makes me cry. PLANE MATERIALS: 
* cardboard
* motor 2205 2300kv
* propeller 5045
* esc 20A FMS (eletric speed controller thing)
* 2x servos 9g
* LiPo battery
* mc6re reviever 
TRANSMITTER MATS: 
* battery
* 2x joy sticks
* arduino nano
* antenna
